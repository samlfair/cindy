## The Author

Cindy Littlefair has written as a freelance columnist and content producer. She's part of the management group for [Lion's Roar](http://lionsroar.com/), the largest English-language Buddhist magazine in North America, and, in terms of public service, was an elected member of the Halifax Regional School Board.

It was the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Nonfiction at University of King's College, Dalhousie, however, that gave her the time and space she needed in order to complete her journey to writer. And the support. Mentors said of her writing and of _Short-Lived_, in particular, that it was "powerful," "well-crafted," and that it "exceeded my already high...expectations."

While at King's, Cindy mastered the craft not only of relaying the details of her family's situation but of telling the story, of drawing out its universality and meaning and themes. Short-Lived is her first book. She is now pitching and writing magazine pieces that employ aspects of Short-Lived as the springboard.

## The Book

_From Cindy Littlefair, a new voice in the tradition of meaning-finding through words, curiosity,  and her own life of death comes_ Short-Lived.

In the Littlefair family, all it took to qualify as a rebel child was curiosity. And staying alive. The rest was gravy. By the time Cindy was 12, four of her five siblings were dead. It wasn't all bad but even when it was good it was troubling.

In retrospect, Cindy knew by age five that something was up. Her family was different from other families, she could feel it. She found photos in the attic of a girl her age, identical in look, who was otherwise nowhere in evidence. Where had she gone? She had a brother. One day he was sharing his secret stash of chocolate cookies with her and the next day he was gone. Forever. Another brother treated her badly enough that his death brought her relief instead of grief. And the fourth, a baby, was small enough almost to escape undetected but now that Cindy knew this was the family's preference she refused to let his memory go.

By the time she's 12, Cindy knows she's had five siblings. Only one remains. She hates that her family is so weird, hates that they die when dying isn't what normal families do, and blames it on god. It's all his fault; she shorts him his capital Gs and Hs in the poetry that becomes her outlet. She also wonders if death is a trend and whether she's next. She spends her adolescence sinking into despair with the general unknowing. School. Boyfriends. Work. Travel. None of it matters. We're all going to die, she thinks, What's the point? She knows this beyond refute and, as a result, is dogged less by a fear of death than a fear of living.

Her parents were no help. They were at sea with their emotions themselves. Instead, they lavished her with love and showed her a life of joy, the family as rich in warmth and humour as it was in tragedy and denial. The ignoring was knee-deep, bodies piling up around them, and if Cindy was going to get anywhere with her own life-palsying confusion, she'd need to dig in. Alone.

Cindy feels her way forward, finding her way up and out of it, deficits in her confidence notwithstanding. She's a true "Wednesday's child," full of inherited woe, a "sobersides" her mother calls her, but she knows that this way lies life. She must indulge her curiosity. All that death and dying, her very own sow's ear.
